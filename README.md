This repo serves as the code for my simple static website. Hosted on github pages of course.

# **THIS IS NO WAY MY ORIGINAL DESIGN**

Inspiration to use this template was done from coming across https://famitown.neocities.org/

I loved the simplicity of it and the aesthetic that I wanted to play around and make it my own (basically just make it green lol)

# All credit should goto the original author of the template: [REPTH!](https://repth.neocities.org/theme)

Let's see more websites looking like this in the future! (:
